## New Functions ##

These are some of the functions I am working on adding to the Toolbox. Depending on the rate of progress, I hope that this list will continue to grow. Crossed out functions are done.

### Endmember Determination (Extraction) Algorithms ###

* ~~Automated Morphological Endmember Extraction (AMEE)~~
* ~~Alternating Volume Maximization (AVMAX)~~
* ~~N-FINDR~~
* Random N-FINDR (RN-FINDR)

### Other ###
* ~~Demo file (guide) for using these functions~~
* ~~Truecolor composite generation from RGB spectral bands~~
